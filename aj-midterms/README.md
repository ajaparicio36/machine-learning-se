## Answers to Questions

### 1. Does preprocessing affect the result of the model? Why?

**Answer:**

Yes, preprocessing, specifically feature scaling in this case, significantly affects the result of the KMeans clustering model. Here's why:

1.  **KMeans is Distance-Based:** KMeans clustering groups data points by trying to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares (inertia), which relies on calculating distances (typically Euclidean) between data points and cluster centroids.

2.  **Sensitivity to Feature Scales:** When features are on vastly different scales, the feature with the larger magnitude and variance will disproportionately influence the distance calculation.

    - In the Melbourne housing dataset, 'Price' values are in the hundreds of thousands to millions, while 'Rooms' are typically single or low double-digit numbers.
    - **Without Scaling (`melbourne-dataset.ipynb`):** The 'Price' feature dominates the distance calculations. As a result, the clusters formed are primarily stratified by price. Differences in the number of 'Rooms' have a much smaller impact on which cluster a property belongs to. The centroids from this notebook reflect this:
      - Cluster 0: Avg Price ~702k, Avg Rooms ~2.63
      - Cluster 1: Avg Price ~1.45M, Avg Rooms ~3.32
      - Cluster 2: Avg Price ~2.82M, Avg Rooms ~4.00
        These clusters mainly represent low, medium, and high price tiers, with 'Rooms' varying somewhat but not being the primary driver of segmentation.

3.  **Effect of Scaling (`melbourne-preprocessed.ipynb`):** Feature scaling transforms the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This brings all features to a comparable scale.

    - **With Scaling:** Both 'Price' and 'Rooms' contribute more equitably to the distance calculations. This allows KMeans to identify underlying patterns based on the combination of both features, rather than being dominated by one. The clusters formed are more nuanced. The centroids (transformed back to original scale) from this notebook show different characteristics:
      - Cluster 0: Avg Price ~709k, Avg Rooms ~1.84 (Smaller, lower-priced properties)
      - Cluster 1: Avg Price ~979k, Avg Rooms ~3.29 (Mid-range price and rooms)
      - Cluster 2: Avg Price ~2.22M, Avg Rooms ~4.03 (Larger, higher-priced properties)

4.  **Impact on Cluster Shape and Interpretation:**
    - Unscaled data often leads to clusters that are elongated along the axis of the dominant feature.
    - Scaled data can lead to more spherical or well-defined clusters (in the scaled space), which often translate to more interpretable segments in the original feature space.

In summary, preprocessing by scaling is crucial for KMeans when features have different units or scales. It ensures that the algorithm is not biased towards features with larger values, leading to more meaningful and balanced clustering results.

### 2. What is your conclusion based on the interpretation or result of your model?

**Answer:**

Based on the interpretation of the KMeans clustering models applied to the Melbourne housing data (using 'Price' and 'Rooms'), my conclusions are:

1.  **Preprocessing is Essential for Meaningful Segmentation:**

    - The model run on **unscaled data** primarily identified price tiers. While this is a valid segmentation, it doesn't fully capture the relationship between price _and_ the number of rooms as intended by a "Price-Size Property Segment" analysis. The 'Price' feature, due to its larger scale, overshadowed the 'Rooms' feature.
    - The model run on **scaled data** provided a more balanced and interpretable segmentation. By scaling the features, both 'Price' and 'Rooms' contributed more equally to the clustering process. This resulted in clusters that represent more distinct combinations of price and size.

2.  **Characteristics of Identified Segments (from Scaled Data, K=3):**
    The clustering on scaled data (with K=3, and centroids transformed back to original scale) revealed the following general property segments:

    - **Segment 0 (e.g., "Compact & Affordable"):** Characterized by a lower average price (around $709k) and fewer rooms (around 1.84). This segment likely includes smaller apartments, units, or houses that are more budget-friendly.
    - **Segment 1 (e.g., "Mid-Range Standard"):** Represents properties with a moderate average price (around $979k) and a moderate number of rooms (around 3.29). This could be typical family homes or larger townhouses.
    - **Segment 2 (e.g., "Spacious & Premium"):** Consists of properties with a significantly higher average price (around $2.22M) and more rooms (around 4.03). This segment likely captures larger houses, luxury properties, or those in very high-demand areas.

3.  **Improved Model Utility with Preprocessing:**
    The insights from the scaled data model are more actionable for understanding market structure. For instance, it distinguishes between properties that are expensive because they are large versus those that might be expensive despite being small (though with only two features, this latter nuance might require more features or a different K). The unscaled model largely just tells us about price brackets.

4.  **Confirmation of KMeans Behavior:**
    The results clearly demonstrate KMeans' sensitivity to feature scaling. This reinforces the best practice of scaling features before applying distance-based clustering algorithms if the features are not already on a comparable scale.

In conclusion, to effectively segment the Melbourne housing market based on both price and the number of rooms, preprocessing through feature scaling is a critical step. It leads to a more nuanced, interpretable, and ultimately more useful model that reflects the interplay between the selected features rather than being dominated by the feature with the largest numerical scale. The scaled model successfully identified distinct property segments that combine aspects of both price and size.
